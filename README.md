# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I will be using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/) to cover React Query concepts.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start``npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
